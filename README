This is the README file for an _unofficial_, _experimental_ version of
FElt - a package for introductory level finite element analysis.


For the official FElt, please visit the original homepage at
http://felt.sourceforge.net. Attention: do NOT bother the original
authors of FElt if you find a bug with the version hosted here.


I created this git repository from the original CVS tree at
sourceforge, in order to hack more easily on the code.  No major new
functionality is planned at the moment, at least before the following
targets are completed:

- clean build with latest gcc compiler on latest linux system.
- removal of obsolete, pre-ANSI code and general code cleanup & simplification
- better extensibility & customization through the use of lua.
- investigate use of external libraries (eg. gsl) for matrix operations
- better build system, based on CMake
- better translations, based on gettext
- rewrite graphical subprograms using a modern toolkit (eg. gtk+ / Qt)


I also plan to sync with upstream, whenever a new version of FElt is released.
