Error codes from 1 to 99 indicate not enough space in some array.
As currently implemented, these errors are unavoidable and you should
try to reduce the size of the generated mesh before proceeding.
Error codes >= 100 mean that the input specification is incorrect,
there is a program bug, or the tolerance TOL is too small or large
(try calling INITCB with a different TOLIN value).
